                <b>Condensation</b> reaction is a reaction in which two molecules combine to form a single molecule. 
                The diagram depicts two molecules forming a single molecule, so it's condensation.
                Because it's a condensation reaction, a polymer is formed, hence the product is a <b>dinucleotide</b>.
